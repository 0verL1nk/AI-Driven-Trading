First, I need to check my existing positions and their exit plans. I have positions in ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, and BNB. All of them are currently in profit except XRP, which is slightly negative.

Available cash is 
4927.64.

I must choose one action per coin: for existing positions, it's either 'hold' or 'close_position'. For coins I'm not in, I can consider entering if there's an opportunity, but I need to be careful not to over-trade.

Let me review each position:

Current price is above entry and above stop loss. RSI (7) is 24.392, which is oversold, but in the intraday, it's been declining. MACD is negative. However, longer-term 4-hour shows MACD positive and RSI around 53.7. Not a clear reason to close yet. I should hold unless invalidation triggers.

Price is slightly below entry. RSI (7) is 45.551, not extreme. MACD is -0.001, flat. Longer-term MACD positive, RSI 58.688. Still within range, no invalidation. Risk is $435.11, which is a fraction of margin. Should hold.

Price above entry and stop loss. RSI (7) 33.192, oversold, MACD negative -1.352, longer-term MACD negative -8.946, RSI 45.617. Still, no invalidation, so hold.

Now, are there any coins I'm not in that I should enter? The coins are ETH, SOL, XRP, BTC, DOGE, BNB. I'm already in all of them, so no new entries. I must only manage existing positions.

For each coin, since I'm in a position, I need to output either 'hold' or 'close_position' based on the exit plan and invalidation condition.

Check if any invalidation condition has triggered or is close to triggering.

None of the invalidation conditions are triggered. Also, stop losses and profit targets are set and will be handled automatically by the exchange, as per the instructions.

So, for all coins, I should output 'hold'.

For 'hold', I need to output the JSON with the full current size, and the same exit plan details: profit_target, stop_loss, invalidation_condition, leverage, confidence, risk_usd.

I must provide this for each coin.

The JSON structure for hold is:

{ "COIN": { "trade_signal_args": { "coin": "COIN", "signal": "hold", "quantity": <full current size>, "profit_target": <float>, "stop_loss": <float>, "invalidation_condition": "<string>", "leverage": <int 5–40>, "confidence": <0–1>,
"risk_usd": <float> } } }

I have the current positions with all these details in the account information.

For example, for ETH:

quantity: 4.87

profit_target: 4227.35

stop_loss: 3714.95

invalidation_condition: "If the price closes below 3800 on a 3-minute candle"

leverage: 15

confidence: 0.75

risk_usd: 624.38

Similarly for others.

I need to output this for all six coins.

Also, in the output, I must have one JSON object per coin, and the entire output should be a JSON object containing these.

The instruction says: "Output JSON only." and "one compact JSON object, no prose."

So, I should output a JSON like:

{ "ETH": { ... }, "SOL": { ... }, "XRP": { ... }, "BTC": { ... }, "DOGE": { ... }, "BNB": { ... } }

Each with the trade_signal_args.

Now, confidence and risk_usd are part of the existing positions, so I should use those values.

I don't need to change anything unless I decide to close, but I'm not closing any.

Finally, ensure that for 'hold', I don't need a justification, as per the JSON example for hold – it doesn't have "justification" key. Only for entry and close, it has justification.

Look back at the JSON examples:

For entry/exit and close, there is "justification", but for hold, in the example, it's not included. Let me check.

In the hold example:

{
  "COIN": {
    "trade_signal_args": {
      "coin": "COIN",
      "signal": "hold",
      "quantity": <full current size>,
      "profit_target": <float>,
      "stop_loss": <float>,
      "invalidation_condition": "<string>",
      "leverage": <int 5–40>,
      "confidence": <0–1>,   
      "risk_usd": <float>
    }
  }
}
No "justification" key. For entry and close, it has "justification".

So for hold, I don't need to add justification.

Similarly, for all coins, since I'm holding, no justification.

Now, output the JSON.
